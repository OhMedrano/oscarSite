  1/3 - 

  		So finally decided to make my own personal site. I want to use this to check 
  		different styles and techniques.

  		What I've done so far is 

  			- Made the layout
  				- The resume and the blog section
  			- Styled it
  			- Made it mobile.


  		What I have to do next

  			- Make the backend
  				- Setup mongodb for CRUD 
  				- Setup backend as API 
  				- Setup backend for static file serve
